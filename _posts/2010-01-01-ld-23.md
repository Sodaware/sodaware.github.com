You control MARRV, a lone robot aboard a generation ship carrying the remains of
a dead planet. The ship has been boarded by evil robots bent on destroying all
life. They have wiped the system memory and are attacking the animals in the
three biomes. 

Your task is to destroy the bombs they have placed and scan the animals so their
DNA can be catalogued for future generations. 

Rather than moving MARVV directly, you give him a set of instructions to
follow.
