Apollo is an entity/component framework for ActionScript, based on the rather
wonderful [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) for Java. 

Instead of building your game objects from class heirarchies, Apollo lets you
build them with components and systems.

See the [experiments](../misc/experiments/) page for a (somewhat) regularly
updated list of experiments built using apollo.


## What it isn't

It's not a replacement for things like Flixel or Flashpunk. They take care of
the stuff people see, Apollo does the "behind the scenes".


## Thanks

Apollo is based on the Artemis framework by [Gamadu](http://gamadu.com), along
with improvements made by [GemSerk](https://github.com/gemserk/artemis).


## Further Reading

Entity systems are a big topic. The following places have lots of information on
them:

Want some examples? Here are some open source projects (mostly written with
Artemis) that you can learn from:
