vault is is very lightweight cache framework that is designed to be
easily integrated with other frameworks (such as
[Tonic](http://peej.github.com/tonic/)). It's only one file, and
currently supports APC caching. Future versions will include support
for memcached and flat files.

## Installing

Vault can either be installed per-project by downloading a copy from
GitHub, or using PEAR.

### GitHub Installation

### PEAR Installation

```bash
pear channel-discover pear.sodaware.net
pear install sodaware/vault
```


## Using vault

```php
include 'vault.php';

// Setup vault with APC
Vault::setup('APC');

// Store something
Vault::store('my_key', 'hello, world');

// Output it
echo Vault::fetch('my_key');

// Clear the cache
Vault::clear();
```


## Supported cache types

The following cache types are currently supported:

* *APC* - requires APC extension
* *Volatile* - fallback in case no other cache methods work
